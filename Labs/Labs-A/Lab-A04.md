## Lab A03: Create a Teams app with Azure AD Single Sign-On

This lab is part of Path A, which begins with a Northwind Orders application that already uses Azure AD.

In this lab you will extend the Northwind Orders application to be a Microsoft Teams application with Azure AD Single Sign-on. The completed solution can be found in the [A03-TeamsSSO](../../A03-TeamsSSO/) folder. The labs that follow will lead you step by step into extending the web application to be a Microsoft Teams application as well.
