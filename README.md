# Microsoft Teams App Camp 2022

This hands-on experience will lead developers through the steps needed to take an existing SaaS app from "zero Microsoft" to a complete Teams app running in the Teams app store. Here are the steps:

1. Starting app written in ES6 with Express server and simple no-framework web pages using ES6 modules.

2. Add a Teams app - Teams personal tab

3. Add Teams tab SSO with identity mapping

4. Add a configuration page - Teams channel tab

?. Add Teams look and feel (??) - and maybe reflect Light/Dark theme from Teams?

5. Add a simple messaging extension w/an adaptive card action

6. Add a simple bot

7. Add a Teams store landing page
